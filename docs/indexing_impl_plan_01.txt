exactly this is what i want - "boost by adding symbolic (AST-based) chunking + semantic embeddings, then retrieving via Chroma before you ask the model to “think.”

shall i create a dir "indexing" within gemcli?
i think if we have separate implementations for symbolic and semantic indexing. again for semantic indexing, i think it is good if we have separate chunkers for file types such as .py, .pdf etc.

let's use chroma db as the vector db.
let's pick/select embedding models from models.json.

we can have rag.json for various rag settings for indexing/chunking, retrieval etc.
since a project has lot of files, including folders/files meant for different purposes like for example .git etc., so i would like to have a rag setting that allows files for indexing, some setting that rejects some files or folders.
for example (you may think or create in better way):
"supported_file_types": [".py", ".txt", ".pdf"]
"ignore_dir": ["__pycache__", "tmp"]
"ignore_ext": [".pyc"]
"ignore_files": ["abc.txt", "__init__.py"]
